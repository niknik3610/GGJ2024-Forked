# Global Game Jam 2024: Choose the Ooze

### What is this?
Our game for the 2024 Leipzig Global Game Jam, written in Unity. View the submission [here](https://globalgamejam.org/games/2024/choose-ooze-6). 

Note: This repo might include improvements to the game that are not in the submission, so if you want the full version, probably build it for yourself from here, or wait for an itch.io link.

### Why is it "forked"?
This is forked because we ran out of git LFS storage on the original one ðŸ˜…. It is not actually forked, I just changed my local origin to this repo, as forking does't reset the bandwidth, however moving to a new repo on a different account does. However, the whole git history is here so don't worry about it.

### How to build?
Download this and open the "Choose the Ooze" folder in Unity. You can build from there.
