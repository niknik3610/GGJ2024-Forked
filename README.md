### What is this?
Our game for the 2024 Leipzig Global Game Jam, written in Unity

### Why is it "forked"
This is forked because we ran out of git LFS storage on the original one ðŸ˜…. It is not actually forked, I just changed my local origin to this repo, as forking does't reset the bandwidth, however moving to a new repo on a different account does. However, the whole git history is here so don't worry about it.

### How to build?
Download this and open the "Choose the Ooze" folder in Unity. You can build from there.
